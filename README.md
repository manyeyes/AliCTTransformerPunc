# AliCTTransformerPunc
#### Introduction:

**AliCTTransformerPunc is a "text punctuation prediction" library written in C#, which uses Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime to decode the ONNX model at the bottom layer, supports framework .Net6.0+, supports cross-platform compilation, and supports AOT compilation. It is simple and convenient to use.**

## Model Introduction:
#### Model Purpose
The Punc model used in the project is the Controllable Time-delay Transformer model open-sourced by Alibaba's Damo Academy. It can be used for punctuation prediction of the text output by the speech recognition model.

#### Model Structure:
Controllable Time-delay Transformer (CTTransformerPunc) is the punctuation module in the efficient post-processing framework proposed by the voice team of Damo Academy. This project is a Chinese general-purpose punctuation model, which can be applied to the punctuation prediction of text input and can also be used in the post-processing steps of speech recognition results to assist the speech recognition module in outputting readable text results.

The structure of the Controllable Time-delay Transformer is shown in the above figure, consisting of three parts: Embedding, Encoder, and Predictor. Embedding is the superposition of word vectors and positional vectors. The Encoder can adopt different network structures, such as self-attention, conformer, SAN-M, etc. The Predictor predicts the type of punctuation after each token.

In terms of model selection, the Transformer model with superior performance was adopted. While the Transformer model has good performance, its serialized input characteristics bring a larger delay to the system. Conventional Transformers can see all future information, causing punctuation to depend on distant future information. This gives users an adverse experience where punctuation keeps changing and the results are not fixed for a long time. Based on this issue, we innovatively proposed the controllable time-delay Transformer model (Controllable Time-Delay Transformer, CT-Transformer), which effectively controls the delay of punctuation without losing model performance.
